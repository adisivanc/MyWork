The tablet, which has features such as a 5MP camera, comes in a 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB form. A Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi + Cellular model are both available. As an added bonus, the iPad Mini comes in both white and black."

If you already have a host of other gadgets, such as the standard size iPad or an iPhone, then the 16GB may be all you need for a sturdy, reliable, on-the-go tablet. The more you plan to do with your tablet, and the more apps you plan to download, the more storage you'll need."

If you're going to be taking it with you on the go, or even using it as an alternative to your cell phone, then Wi-Fi + Cellular is a must. However, if you only plan to use it at home, with the occasional outing to work or the local bookstore, plain Wi-Fi may be a better and more affordable alternative."

Other accessories may be packaged along with the iPad Mini when it's being offered by a private seller on Gumtree. If you want to save a little money or even just want a little convenience consider scoping out package deals that include items such as the Smart Cover, Bluetooth keyboards, and a stylus.<br /><br />Check out the options on Gumtree, and you can have a great gadget at your disposal for a very fair price."
