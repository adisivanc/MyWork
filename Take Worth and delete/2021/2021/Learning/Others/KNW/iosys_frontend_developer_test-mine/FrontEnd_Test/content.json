            "description": "The iPad Mini is one of the latest offerings in Apple's stable of tablet computers, and as the name suggests differs from its older siblings in that it is much smaller in size.<br /><br />Just because the iPad Mini is physically smaller in size doesn't mean it's smaller in computing power. The tablet, which has features such as a 5MP camera, comes in a 16 GB, 32 GB, and 64 GB form. A Wi-Fi and a Wi-Fi + Cellular model are both available. As an added bonus, the iPad Mini comes in both white and black."

            "description": "If you're trying to decide which of the options 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB is right for you, you need to think about how you plan to use your iPad Mini. If you already have a host of other gadgets, such as the standard size iPad or an iPhone, then the 16GB may be all you need for a sturdy, reliable, on-the-go tablet. The more you plan to do with your tablet, and the more apps you plan to download, the more storage you'll need."

            "description": "Whether or not you need cellular for your iPad Mini depends on, again, how you're going to use it. If you're going to be taking it with you on the go, or even using it as an alternative to your cell phone, then Wi-Fi + Cellular is a must. However, if you only plan to use it at home, with the occasional outing to work or the local bookstore, plain Wi-Fi may be a better and more affordable alternative."
