                <p>Specificity in CSS is a way to determine which CSS rules will be applied to an element when there are
                    multiple conflicting rules targeting the same element. It is used by the browser to determine the
                    priority or specificity of CSS rules and resolve conflicts.</p>
                <p>The specificity of a CSS selector is calculated based on the components of the selector and their
                    corresponding values. The following factors contribute to the specificity value:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Inline styles: Inline styles have the highest specificity because they are directly applied to
                            the element using the <code>style</code> attribute. They are specified within the element's HTML
                            tag and override any other CSS rules.</p>
                            <b><pre>1,0,0,0</pre></b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>IDs: Selectors with ID attributes have higher specificity than classes and elements. An ID
                            selector is denoted by the <code>#</code> symbol followed by the ID value.</p>
                            <b><pre>0,1,0,0</pre></b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes: Selectors with classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes
                            have a lower specificity than IDs. They are denoted by a dot (<code>.</code>) for classes,
                            square brackets (<code>[]</code>) for attributes, or a colon (<code>:</code>) for
                            pseudo-classes.</p>
                            <b><pre>0,0,1,0</pre></b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Elements and pseudo-elements: Selectors based on element names or pseudo-elements have the lowest
                            specificity. They are denoted by the element name or the <code>::</code> notation for
                            pseudo-elements.</p>
                            <b><pre>0,0,0,1</pre></b>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The specificity is calculated by assigning a specific weight or value to each component of the selector.
                    The more specific components a selector has, the higher the specificity value. In case of conflicts, the
                    browser applies the rule with the highest specificity.</p>
                <p>If two or more rules have the same specificity, the order in which they appear in the CSS file becomes
                    the deciding factor. The last rule encountered by the browser will take precedence.</p>
                <p>Understanding the concept of specificity is crucial for writing maintainable and predictable CSS code. It
                    helps you control which styles are applied to specific elements and avoid unintended styling conflicts.
