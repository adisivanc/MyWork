        The <xmp>`<embed>`, `<object>`, and `<iframe>`</xmp> tags are used in HTML to embed external content or media into a web page. While they serve similar purposes, there are differences in how they are used and what they are best suited for:

        1. <xmp>`<embed>`</xmp> tag: The <xmp>`<embed>`</xmp> tag is used to embed external content, typically multimedia files, such as audio or video, into an HTML document. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.
        The content is specified using the `src` attribute, which points to the URL of the file to be embedded. This tag is generally supported by most modern browsers.
        
        <xmp>
        Example:
        ```html
        <embed src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        ```
        </xmp>

        2. <xmp>`<object>`</xmp> tag: The <xmp>`<object>`</xmp> tag is a versatile tag used to embed various types of external content, including multimedia files and other types of content, such as images, Flash animations, or Java applets. 
        It provides more flexibility and allows alternative content to be displayed if the embedded content is not supported. The content is specified using the `data` attribute, which points to the URL of the file to be embedded.

        <xmp>
        Example:
        ```html
        <object data="flash.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">
            <img src="fallback-image.jpg" alt="Fallback image">
        </object>
        ```
        </xmp>

        3. <xmp>`<iframe>`</xmp> tag: This tag is used to embed a separate HTML document within the current document. It allows you to display content from another website or a different part of the same website. 
        The content is specified using the `src` attribute, which points to the URL of the external document. <xmp>`<iframe>`</xmp> tags are commonly used for embedding maps, videos, or social media content. 
        It provides a way to isolate the embedded content from the main document, as it acts as a separate browsing context.

        <xmp>
        Example:
        ```html
        <iframe src="https://www.example.com"></iframe>
        ```
        </xmp>

        In summary, the <xmp>`<embed>`</xmp> tag is primarily used for embedding multimedia files, the <xmp>`<object>`</xmp> tag offers versatility for embedding various types of content, and the <xmp>`<iframe>`</xmp> tag is used to embed an external HTML document or isolate content from the main document. 
        The choice of which tag to use depends on the specific requirements and the type of content you want to embed.
