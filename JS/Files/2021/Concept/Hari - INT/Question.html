A milling machine is implemented as a circular buffer, containing a list of tools (duplicates allowed), and it can move forwards/backwards by one position to select the desired tool.

You'll receive as input:

an Array of tools, representing the circular list
k, the index of the tool currently being in use
q, the string of the next tool we want to use ( q âˆˆ tools)
And have to determine

the (absolute) minimum steps needed, either backwards or forwards), for moving from tool at index k and reach tool q
